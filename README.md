I based my keyboard on the already existing one designed by a (seemingly) non-Limbu Nepali artist. I grouped the vowels together to the right for ease of access as in the old keyboard they were scattered, which in my view would lead to confusion as the vowels in languages such as Limbu which use an abugida, are not to be treated as separate letters, but only as diacritic markers, therefore, a quick way to access them to me seems desirable. Additionally, I grouped all standard forms of the consonants in the lower case, with their endings and cluster forms in the upper case. The unused and unutilized ᤨ is also grouped in the upper case. I added the lesser used letters on the upper case, keeping a pattern of letters and their aspirated forms, and the Nepali foreign language letters were also placed in the upper case as they are not used. I replaced all numbers with the Sirijanga numbers, and all punctuations with their Sirijanga forms, and grouped unused punctuation marks and glyphs in the upper case and in some cases the AltGr case. Additionally I streamlined the entire keyboard and added the “om” character in its middle as a final step, signifying Limbu’s deep ties to its religious scriptures in its indigenous religion of Kirat Mundhum.
